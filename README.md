## Getting Started
    ffmpeg -i "video_filename" frame%04d.png
to extract frames from a video.

Run `upscale.sh` to upscale the image to 512p (Discord's minimum for assets) if the source video is less than 512p.

The rest of the instructions are in the RPC_animation.py file. No python knowledge required!
